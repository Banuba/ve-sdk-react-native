# AI Clipping

The ```AI Clipping``` feature automates the video creation process by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. The neural network transforms raw input into ready-to-post videos with various transitions, effects, and a precise music match.

Here is how users can interact with it:

1. User selects clips and music. People can choose their desired clips and accompanying music within the app.
2. AI trims the videos. The AI algorithm intelligently trims the selected clips to match the tempo and rhythm of the chosen track.
3. AI adds various effects. AI Clipping enhances the content by adding a variety of effects to create visually stunning content.
4. User exports, edits, or regenerates the clip. Upon completion, users have the flexibility to export the video as is, make further edits, or regenerate the clip for a fresh perspective.
5. Regardless of the userâ€™s editing skills, with the help of Auto Cut, everyone can get a stunning video within seconds.
