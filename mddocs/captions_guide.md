# Closed Captions

AI Captions are a textual representation of the audio within a media file.

Over 80% of videos played on mobile devices donâ€™t have sound turned on. This means many forms of content (e.g. skits, monologues, educational clips, etc.) will be skipped if there are no subtitles. But making captions by hand is tedious. AI-generated subtitles solve this issue, as they are created and placed automatically. The users can then edit the text as well as change its style and color.

[AWS Transcribe service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/) is used to generate captions.
